### Hi, my name is Glen Pearson and I work under the name gtpWebDev

- ❓ - After a long career in finance, I'm in the process of re-training to be a web developer. I'm expecting to focus on back-end, but I still have an open mind.

- 🕸 - For almost 2 years I've been exploring the world of web3, which is where my interest in web dev came about, but up until the start of 2024 everything I developed was really just hacked together - I really only cared about whether I could get something to work

- ❗ - In 2024 I decided to focus my energies on training to be a fully-fledged web development professional, so now I need to start thinking about whether I'm building things in the right way!

- 📖 - Right now, I'm working through the Odin Project, forcing myself to completely re-learn everything I thought I knew about html, css, javascript, react, etc... The course has a lot of familiar content, but I'm learning so much every day.

- 📫 - I'm very keen to hear from fellow students who are going through a similar process. I'm very open to discussing projects, reviewing each other's work, or anything else that wil help with my professional development. If this would interest you, feel free to get in touch by e-mail on glenonholiday@yahoo.co.uk.
