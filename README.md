### Hi there, my name is Glen Pearson and I develop under the name gtpWebDev

- ❓ - After a long career in finance, I'm in the process of re-training to be a web developer. I'm expecting to focus on back-end, but I still have an open mind.

- 🕸 For almost 2 years I've been exploring the world of web3, which is where my interest in web dev came about, but up until the start of 2024 everything I developed was really just hacked together, with my only concern being whether I could get whatever tool I was working on to work.

- ❗ In 2024 I decided to focus my energies on training to be a fully-fledged web development professional.

- 📖 Right now, I'm working through the Odin Project, forcing myself to completely re-learn everything I thought I knew about html, css, javascript, react, data structures, you name it...

- 📫 I'm very keen to hear from fellow students who are going through a similar process. I'm very open to discussing projects, reviewing each other's work, or anything else that wil help with my professional development. Feel free to get in touch on glenonholiday@yahoo.co.uk
